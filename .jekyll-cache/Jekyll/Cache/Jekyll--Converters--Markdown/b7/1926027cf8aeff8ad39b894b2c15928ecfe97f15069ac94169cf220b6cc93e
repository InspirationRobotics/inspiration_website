I"ª<p>We are a 9th-year robotics team from San Diego, California, with students ranging from 8th grade to 12th grade.</p>

<p>We currently participate in the FIRST Tech Challenge, RoboSub, and Donkey Car robotics programs. Our goal is to be able to learn the most we can about robotics and to spread all that knowledge to others, as seen through our team motto:  <strong>To learn, to share, to innovate, to inspire!</strong></p>
