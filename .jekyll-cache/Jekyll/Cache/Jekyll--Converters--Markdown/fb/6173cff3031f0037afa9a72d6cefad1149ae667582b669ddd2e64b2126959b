I"U<p>Donkey Car also called Robocar, is a DIY self-driving vehicle that utilizes cameras and a servo shield, both programmed by a Raspberry Pi computer. Teams use neural networks so their cars “learn” from the many test runs which train the cars how to drive on the track. Many of these Donkey cars compete against one another on a predetermined race track in the Robocar program. There are different levels to the competition, where anybody from rookies to experts can participate.</p>

<p><strong>We’ve competed in the competition for over three years and have built four cars.</strong></p>
