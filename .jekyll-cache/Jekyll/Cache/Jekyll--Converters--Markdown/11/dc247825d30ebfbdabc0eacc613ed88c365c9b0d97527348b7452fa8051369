I"Ù<p><strong>Weâ€™ve competed in the international, university-level Robosub competition since 2019.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>In 2019, as a rookie team, we focused on getting a solid set of fundamentals, pre-qualified, and ranked 12th out of the 55 competing teams.</li>
  <li>In 2020, due to the pandemic, efforts were shifted to focus on a virtual competition. Through hard work and careful planning, we became the first middle/high school team to ever win the Robosub competition in its 23+ year history!</li>
  <li>This year, weâ€™re leveling up. Weâ€™re partnering with more companies and professionals to build top-tier robots, with a continued focus on simulation and preparing for the 2022 in-person competition.</li>
